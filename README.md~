# node-canvas-aws-lambda

Node canvas module with compiled dependency libraries. Based on https://github.com/WebSeed/node-canvas-aws-lambda-example - added some additional libs that were required. Nice how to guide for compiling libraries on EC2 instance, and script that does libs downloading and compiling for you (simple script which could break if i.e. curl fails downloading...)
